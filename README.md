# PreTrainedTopsis-102217114

<h1>Project Summary</h1>
<h2>Topsis can be applied to evaluate pre-trained models for text-based conversations by ranking them based on multiple performance criteria. First, each model's performance is assessed across these criteria using standardized metrics. The results are then normalised to bring them to a comparable scale. In the topsis approach, an ideal solution and a negaticve ideal solution are determined. Each model's distance from these two reference points is calculates, and the models are ranked based on their closeness to the ideal solution. This methods provided a systematic way to compare pre-trained conversational models, ensuring a balanced evaluation across multiple factors.</h2>
